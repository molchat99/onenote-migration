(To see the effect - is it really useful or can it be omitted? Advantage of omitting: channels are not demaged) Identical settings as for printing channels with CMCMA4+5 are chosen   Channel protrusions out of the GelMA bulk seem to be longer and more intact than when printing with CMCMA4+5 (discernible when looking at brightfield keyence photos)  Prints themselves look very defined",
