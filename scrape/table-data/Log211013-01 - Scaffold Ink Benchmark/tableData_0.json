After checking (ink was cured), the printhead manually was lowered by 50 mm with the idea to achieve the Z coordinates of where the print was paused. The printhead moved down onto the dish and did ca. 5x Z bounces in quick succession (ca. 5 mm height) before coming to rest in the dish. Due to marks left in the PDMS surface, it became evident that the printhead was driving down too far and into the dish.",
