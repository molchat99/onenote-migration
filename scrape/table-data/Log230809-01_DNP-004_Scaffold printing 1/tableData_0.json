Pause after layer 1 and washing/dapping: printed structures okay, continued until end. Manually dried with Kimwipe after each dabbing. Very soft GelMA - rim printed but not visible, microscopic images show bad definition of edges & CMCMA channels appear to fat -> probably to soft  and squished by next layer. Changed printer settings: Hover factor: 2; washOffset: 10, dabTime: 3, WashRule: Before Exposure. Vats and printhead cleaned. Ink recycled.  Both scaffolds collected in DPBS and microscoped. Then incubation in DPBS with 5K U/mL lysozyme.",
