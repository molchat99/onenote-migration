Vol. T2: 600 µL (layer 2). Washing channels: dipping, then rinsing 3x1 mL warm DPBS with pipette, removing excess liquid with KimWipe (touching channels) Only 2 perfect prints with complete channels; 2 prints have incomplete channels, and channels of 2 prints barely there All prints seem to be too thick --> difficult to roll, and had slight overcuring Rolling of 3 prints, glueing with T1-220831MF in PD Pipette, then irradiation in UV chamber for 1 min. rolling was easier when prints were quite dried out All collected in separate 24-ULA-wells with 0.5 mL 2x Hase in ECGM2 +P/S",
