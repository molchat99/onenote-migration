Vol. T2: 600 µL (layer 2).  Washing channels: dipping, then rinsing 5x0.6 mL warm DPBS with pipette, removing excess liquid with KimWipe (touching channels). Store in warm ECGM2 until further use.  Well-defined prints, 4/6 with small airbubbles in top layer --> on position  2-6 in well plate. Prints 5&6 only missing one part due to airbubble in first layer. Channels good in every print.  Transferring all at the same time into separate 24-ULA wells with 0.5 mL 2x Hase in ECGM2 +P/S (230604 MF).",
