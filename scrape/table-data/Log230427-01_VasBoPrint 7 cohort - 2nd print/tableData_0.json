Vol. T2: 400 µL (layer 2).  Washing channels: dipping, removing excess liquid with KimWipe (touching channels). Store in warm ECGM2 until further use.  T1 in layer 1 can be less ink (total netting of printhead), but in layer 3 was too little -> increase vol. there. Vol. of T2 OK but netting was not uniform centrally. All prints look good but 2/4 with missing part on short side because too little T1 vol. in layer 3. Channels visible macroscopically but not with microscope. Was HAMA really cured or channel structures only \"burned\" into GelMA?  All observed and discarded.",
