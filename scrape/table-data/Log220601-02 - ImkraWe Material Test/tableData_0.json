Trial to remove it tears all prints apart: parts stick to printhead, parts to FEP film -> the film in vat AL_005 seems to be a different product than that of previously used blue metal ink vat i.e. less non-adhesive -> switch back to blue metal ink vat. Moreover, decision to reduce disc size to 6 mm (96-well plate).",
      "next steps": "Switch out ink vat. Create new CAD with smaller discs. Repeat print (see Log220601-03)",
