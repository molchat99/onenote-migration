Vol. T2: 600 µL (layer 2).  Washing channels: dipping, then rinsing 5x0.6 mL warm DPBS with pipette, removing excess liquid with KimWipe (touching channels). Store in warm ECGM2 until further use.  First layer seems to be a little bit to thin. Good definition of channels. Definition of last layer is poor. But all prints complete - no ait bubbles.  Transferring all at the same time into separate 24-ULA wells with 0.5 mL 2x Hase in ECGM2 +P/S (230609 MF).",
