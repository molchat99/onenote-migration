Placing small piece of plastic foil (biohazard table garbage bag) on ceramic sponge to avoid damage to printhead. After homing, removal of glasses and placing ink vats. Vol.: 500 µL T2; 500 µL T1. Pauses after all dapping steps to evaluate print and remove excess liquid with pipet. Both printed scaffolds look super and are collected in DPBS with 5KU/mL lysozyme. Incubation at 37 °C over night.",
