Suction forces/movement of FEP film during printing caused distortion. Moreover, one print with small ripped off part at one long side (towards walls of reservoir). Both prints washed in warm tap water on printhead and then detached with a Spachtel. Put into bath with warm tap water and 15 min post-cured at RT in FormCure.",
